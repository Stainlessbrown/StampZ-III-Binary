# Auto-Save Averages Feature Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a preference toggle for automatically saving averaged colors to the database in Compare mode, eliminating the need to manually click the "Save Average to Database" button each time.

## Changes Made

### 1. Preferences Structure (`preferences.json`)
- Added new `compare_mode_prefs` section with `auto_save_averages: false` as the default setting

### 2. User Preferences Manager (`utils/user_preferences.py`)
- Added `CompareModePreferences` dataclass with `auto_save_averages` field
- Updated `UserPreferences` to include `compare_mode_prefs`
- Added getter/setter methods: `get_auto_save_averages()` and `set_auto_save_averages()`
- Updated `load_preferences()` and `save_preferences()` to handle the new section

### 3. Preferences Dialog (`gui/preferences_dialog.py`)
- Added new "Compare Mode" tab with:
  - Checkbox for "Automatically save averaged colors to database"
  - Explanation of the feature's behavior
  - Information about Compare mode functionality
- Updated `_load_current_settings()` to load the preference
- Updated `_apply_settings()` to save the preference

### 4. Compare Mode Functionality (`gui/color_comparison_manager.py`)
- Modified `_update_average_display()` method to:
  - Check the auto-save preference using `get_preferences_manager()`
  - Automatically call `_save_average_to_database()` when auto-save is enabled
  - Only display the manual "Save Average to Database" button when auto-save is disabled

## Feature Behavior

### When Auto-Save is Enabled (Toggle ON)
- Averaged colors are automatically saved to the database whenever an average is calculated
- The "Save Average to Database" button is hidden since it's no longer needed
- No manual user action required

### When Auto-Save is Disabled (Toggle OFF) - Default
- Users must manually click the "Save Average to Database" button to save averages
- Maintains original workflow for users who prefer manual control
- Button remains visible and functional

## Benefits

1. **Workflow Efficiency**: Eliminates repetitive button clicking for users who always want to save averages
2. **User Choice**: Provides a toggle option - users can choose automatic or manual behavior
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Default setting (disabled) maintains existing workflow
4. **UI Simplification**: When auto-save is enabled, removes unnecessary UI elements

## User Experience

- Users can access this setting via **Preferences â†’ Compare Mode** tab
- Setting takes effect immediately after applying preferences
- Clear explanation provided in the preferences dialog about what the feature does
- The manual button completely disappears when auto-save is enabled, providing a cleaner interface

## Technical Notes

- Preference is stored persistently in the user's preferences file
- Uses existing database saving functionality - no changes to save mechanism required
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Compare mode workflow
- Maintains all existing quality control and error handling for database operations

This implementation successfully addresses the original request to move the "Save averages to database" button functionality into a preference toggle, making it either always on or always off based on user choice.
